== Acts as Kuler ==
This is intended as a sort of open source version of adobe's kuler tool.

It is a web site in which one can create themes of five colors, and rate them, and clone someone else's theme.
There should be commenting too.  And unicorns.

Things I'd like to do:
  - implement starbox: http://www.nickstakenburg.com/projects/starbox/
    - Might scratch this, the license is crap
  - implement a better star rater: http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2007/01/css-star-rating-redux/
